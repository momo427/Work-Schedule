# Work-Schedule
Purpose: use for daily planner to create a schedule
When you open the planner you should see the current time and date
When you scroll down, you are presented with timeblocks (with standard business hours)
When you view the time blocks for that day each time block is color coded (preset: past: future:)
When you click into the timeblock you can enter in an event 
When you click the save button for the corresponding timeblock the text is saved to your local storage
When you refresh the page, then the saved event persists
